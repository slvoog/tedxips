# Welcome to TEDxIPS

At TEDxIPS, we believe in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives, and ultimately, the world. Our mission is to bring together bright young minds to give talks that are idea-focused, and on a wide range of subjects, to foster learning, inspiration, and wonder – and provoke conversations that matter.

### About TEDxIPS

TEDxIPS is an independently organized TED event part of the [TEDx program](https://www.ted.com/tedx), operated under license from TED. Our goal is to create a platform for thinkers, visionaries, and storytellers to share their ideas and inspire our community.

### What is TEDx?

In the spirit of discovering and spreading ideas, TED has created a program called [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/tedx). TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxIPS where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxIPS event, TED Talks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

### What to Expect

- **Inspiring Talks**: Hear from a diverse group of speakers who are experts in their fields, sharing their unique perspectives and groundbreaking ideas.
- **Engaging Workshops**: Participate in interactive sessions designed to spark creativity and innovation.
- **Networking Opportunities**: Connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about making a difference.
