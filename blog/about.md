# About TEDxIPS

At TEDxIPS, we believe in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives, and ultimately, the world. Our mission is to bring together bright young minds to give talks that are idea-focused, and on a wide range of subjects, to foster learning, inspiration, and wonder – and provoke conversations that matter.

## Our Mission

TEDxIPS is an independently organized TED event, operated under license from TED. Our goal is to create a platform for thinkers, visionaries, and storytellers to share their ideas and inspire our community.

## What to Expect

- **Inspiring Talks**: Hear from a diverse group of speakers who are experts in their fields, sharing their unique perspectives and groundbreaking ideas.
- **Engaging Workshops**: Participate in interactive sessions designed to spark creativity and innovation.
- **Networking Opportunities**: Connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about making a difference.

## About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of discovering and spreading ideas, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

## About TED
TED is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to discovering, debating and spreading ideas that spark conversation, deepen understanding and drive meaningful change. Our organization is devoted to curiosity, reason, wonder and the pursuit of knowledge — without an agenda. We welcome people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world and connection with others, and we invite everyone to engage with ideas and activate them in your community.

TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, but today it spans a multitude of worldwide communities and initiatives exploring everything from science and business to education, arts and global issues. In addition to the TED Talks curated from our annual conferences and published on TED.com, we produce original [podcasts](https://audiocollective.ted.com/), [short video series](https://www.ted.com/series), [animated educational lessons (TED-Ed)](https://ed.ted.com/) and TV programs that are translated into more than 100 languages and distributed via partnerships around the world. Each year, thousands of independently run [TEDx events](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program) bring people together to share ideas and bridge divides in communities on every continent. Through the [Audacious Project](https://www.audaciousproject.org/), TED has helped catalyze more than $3 billion in funding for projects that seek to make the world more beautiful, sustainable and just. In 2020, TED launched [Countdown](https://countdown.ted.com/), an initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis and mobilize a movement for a net-zero future, and in 2023 TED launched [TED Democracy](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/teddemocracy) to spark a new kind of conversation focused on realistic pathways towards a more vibrant and equitable future.
